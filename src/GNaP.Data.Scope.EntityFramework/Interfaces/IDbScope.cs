    /// You typically use an EntityFrameworkScope at the business logic service level. Each
    /// business transaction (i.e. each service method) that uses Entity Framework must
    /// be wrapped in an EntityFrameworkScope, ensuring that the same DbContext instances
    /// are used throughout the business transaction and are committed or rolled
    /// back atomically.
    ///
    /// Think of it as TransactionScope but for managing DbContext instances instead
    /// of database transactions. Just like a TransactionScope, an EntityFrameworkScope is
    /// ambient, can be nested and supports async execution flows.
    ///
    /// And just like TransactionScope, it does not support parallel execution flows.
    /// You therefore MUST suppress the ambient EntityFrameworkScope before kicking off parallel
    /// tasks or you will end up with multiple threads attempting to use the same DbContext
    /// instances (use IDbScopeFactory.SuppressAmbientScope() for this).
    ///
    /// You can access the DbContext instances that this scopes manages via either:
    /// - its Get() method, or
    /// - an IAmbientDbContextLocator

    /// or query classes to access the ambient DbContext instances without giving them access to the actual
    /// EntityFrameworkScope).
